Question 16: Name something you like about Prolog. Explain.
I like its simplicity. If you know how to phrase the question you want to answer,
prolog will figure out the rest for you.

Question 17: Name something you dislike about Prolog. Explain.
The syntax is hard for newbies.

Question 18: Did you enjoy this lab? Which aspects did you like and/or dislike?
I enjoyed the use of logic to solve these problems, I found it very satisfying. 
I also enjoyed learning a little history along the way.

Question 19: Approximately how many hours did you spend on this lab?
I spent approximately 2 hours. Most of the time was spent figuring out that
you could put two rules with the same name back to back.

Question 20: Do you think you will use Prolog again? For which type(s) of project(s)?
I feel I would use prolog again, especially if I have a database of rules that I need
to parse. I get the feeling that prolog is very good at this sort of thing.
